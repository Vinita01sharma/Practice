HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent reserved characters, 
symbols, and other characters that have a specific meaning in HTML. 
These entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a code or name, 
and ending with a semicolon (;).

Here are some common HTML entities:

1. &lt; - Less than sign (<)
2. &gt; - Greater than sign (>)
3. &amp; - Ampersand (&)
4. &quot; - Quotation mark (")
5. &apos; - Apostrophe (')
6. &nbsp; - Non-breaking space
7. &copy; - Copyright symbol (©)
8. &reg; - Registered trademark symbol (®)
9. &euro; - Euro symbol (€)
10. &pound; - Pound sterling symbol (£)
11. &yen; - Yen symbol (¥)
12. &deg; - Degree symbol (°)
13. &trade; - Trademark symbol (™)
14. &times; - Multiplication sign (×)
15. &divide; - Division sign (÷)

These entities can be used in HTML to display special characters that may 
not be easily typed on a keyboard or may have a specific meaning in HTML markup. 
By using HTML entities, developers can ensure that special characters are rendered 
correctly in web pages across different browsers and devices. -->
