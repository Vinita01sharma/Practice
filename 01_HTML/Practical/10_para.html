        <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the render page.
        HTML provides a means to create structured document by denoting structural semantics for text such as <i>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</i>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags,written using <u>angle bracket.</u> Tags such as < img/ > and < input/ > directly introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as < p/ > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the conntent of the page.
